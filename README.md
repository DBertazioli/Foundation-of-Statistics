## Final Assignment

A) choose a dataset with continuous dependent var Y and mixed (categorical /quantitative) covariates  Xj and analyze: 
  
- Descriptive analysis on Y (shape, density, statistics), plots 
- Test on a mean (justify H0) on Y and confidence limits. 
- Test two means, two variances (Y vs X binary). 
- Association/chi square among some couples of categorical Xj  
- Anova one way Y = Xj, for a categorical X 
- Anova two way Y = Xj Xk for some categorical X 
- Ancova Y = all covariates (qualitative +quantitative) 

Do A) and PRINT main outputs for discussion (test, figures, parameters, p-value, fit, error, OR, lsmeans, LRT, normality tests,..) the day of the oral. 
 
For the exam, please…prepare yourself to discuss and illustrate: 
 
- AIMS and Objectives (research question); 
 
- MOTIVATION OF USED DATASET 
Study your data, select cases, variables,…why?  
 
- CONCLUSIONS 
Empirical findings are in line with aims and expectations?  
 
NB 
Do not prepare a thesis or a presentation, print only important output for discussion.  
(If you want to do a presentation ok, but output must be printed on paper!) 
 
SOFTWARE: SAS o R , as you want
